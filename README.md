# CoffeeShopDAProject

My client, a coffee shop owner, was struggling with inventory management and needed a way to track weekly income. To address these challenges, I developed a SQL-driven analysis and database design solution that streamlined operations and provided clear financial insights.

**Inventory Management:** Developed queries to monitor stock levels and predict reorder points.
/**Income Reporting:** Implemented queries to generate detailed weekly income reports, helping the client make informed business decisions.
