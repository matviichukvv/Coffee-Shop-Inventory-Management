# Coffee Shop Inventory Management

For a practice project, I worked on solving problems for a pretend coffee shop. The project was about improving how the shop managed its inventory and tracked its weekly income. I used SQL to create a database and analysis system that made everything easier to manage and gave clear financial information.  

**Inventory Management:** Created SQL queries to keep track of stock and predict when new items need to be ordered.  
**Income Reporting:** Made queries that generate weekly income reports to help with business decisions based on the pretend shop's earnings.
